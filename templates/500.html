	<p>I'm really sorry, but there's an error in the site.  I tried so hard to get everything right.  Do you need a hug?</p>
	<p>I notified Natasha to tell her that there's a problem, I'm sure she'll fix it soon.  You can try again in a little while, if that's ok with you, maybe it'll work then.</p>
	<p><sub>I wish I could fix it for you myself...maybe someday...</sub></p>
	<p><strong><em>Oh!</em></strong>  I almost forgot, you can also report problems on GitHub!  All you have to do is <a href="https://github.com/lupinia/awi/issues">open an issue about this</a>, it's really easy!  Just make sure you say a little something about what you were doing, and include this part:  <code>{{error_value}}</code>.</p>
	<p><sub>And, umm, please be nice?  If that's ok with you?</sub></p>
